**Dear Ezekiel,**

>You're finally here! We've been preparing the way for your arrival and we're over joyed that you are here. On May 11th at 11:59, you have come into the world and changed our lives forever. God has given you're mom and I the privilege of being your parents.

>As your father I promise to do my best to raise you up in the ways that God has planned for you. 

>My prayer for you is that you will know God and that from knowing God you will understand His great love for you. From knowing God, and understanding his Love for you, I also pray that your character will be shaped by it, and that you will have an inner guidance to face the world.

>Zeke, you will grow to be of great stature and deep character. You will love well, and be courageous by caring for others and defending others.

>Your mother and I will always be your parents, but also we will always partner with you and walk with your in your faith journey.
