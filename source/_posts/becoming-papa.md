title: Becoming Papa
---

The title of this post was inspired by, I suppose, a number of influences. But most recently, watching the movie *The Shack*, a book by William P. Young. The characters in the book at one point or another affectionately call God Papa. And, I remember reading the book a few years back while on deployment, calling God *Papa* seemd a little too casual and too intimate. But hey, if people felt they were that close to God then that's cool. I just didn't really call him that.

It wouldn't be until couple of years after reading the book that I met some friends that would start every prayer Papa. At the time I had just gotten through some emotional pain and greif. So it seemed these sets of friends asking *Papa* to answer prayers seemed so much more apprpriate and inviting. To this day, I can't really pray to "papa", yet, when I hear other call God Papa it strikes a warmth in me.

This year, I will become a Papa. The first child, that everyone says will change your life. It's obvious by the sheer amount of decisions and baby topics and things a "first-world" parent gets immersed in.
