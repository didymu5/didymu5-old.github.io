Dear Ezekiel,
You're finally here! We've been preparing the way for your arrival and we're over joyed that you are here. On May 11th at 11:59, you have come into the world and changed our lives forever. God has given you're mom and I the privelage of being your parents.

As your father I promise to do my best to raise you up in the ways that God has planned for you. Our prayer is that your character will be shaped by God and that you'll grow to be of great stature; that you will learn to love well, be courageous and defend others. We want to be partners with you in your faith journey to know God and worship Him.
