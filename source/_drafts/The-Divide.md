When I visit San Francisco, it's hard for me to ignore the blatant disparity between the rich and the poor.  On my commute to work, I walk past the same people experiencing homelessness every single day. I see the tents, the signs, the makeshift beds and the people scurrying past â€” right outside my office lobby. And when I badge in, I eat free catered lunches and dinners and complain about the rate fancy snacks are consumed. The dichotomy between these two worlds seems impossible to close. How can it be that in a city so innovative and wealthy, so many homeless line the streets?
