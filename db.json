It's since college that I started this small personal endevor. Life has a bunch of distractions and it's easy for me to get sidetracked for my personal projects with the pitfalls of trying to decide what's the best platform to do this on. And then of course there's the personal time produce something that I won't be too ashamed of, while questioning the movtivation and reasons I'm blogging.\n\n## Many choices for a CMS\n\nThere was a time when Wordpress was the \"it\" CMS for bloggers and content creators. It involved [\"LAMP\"][1] stack, which means you needed a Linux server with PHP, Apache, and MySQL to be installed. Then you're left customizing clunky Wordpress ecosystem and server maintenance or costs just to make your website look 'custom'.\n\nThere were several other notable CMS that people were interested in, Textpattern, Drupal, ExpressionEngine - all LAMP type of solutions. Do this day I've removed PHP from my resume and refuse to do it and much less deal with a customized Wordpress installation. Every so often recruiters will still ask if I'd be interested in a PHP position - a lack of thoughtfulness when reading the resume or professional profiles.\n\n## BYO--CMS\nAt the time I was in college Ruby on Rails was getting popular, and it was awesome development experience and best software development practices. Rails weren't the only [MVC][MVC] framework, PHP had [CodeIgnitor][codeignitor] and Zend frameworks, to name a couple, but all of the solutions required server maintenance.\n\nHosted CMS costs money, even if you're using it for free. And free stuff eventually becomes adware - BOO! At some point, if you didn't pay for something slick like Squarespace, your content doesn't become yours anymore. It get's lost among the sea of all other content produced by strangers. This gets me to my point of blogging and writing in this medium. My content is my own, so hence I want the content to be focused and a place for me to reflect on my own. It serves as a log of my collection of thoughts.

This blog is a bunch of static HTML pages generated on my local computer. And there are a ton of solutions for this, but for me, this is as simple as it gets, and simplicity is key when it comes getting myself to write more and self-publish. Static site generation solves my immediate problem and I'm not having to sign up for another account. Granted there is a bit of a setup overhead, with a GitHub repo, and choosing a static site generator, in this case, [Hexo](https://hexo.io/). This allows me to have a simple markdown file as my medium to write and format words on to the screen.\n\n## Solving problems by not solving them\nThere's not a whole lot of features to this method, but it solves my problem. It encourages me to not solving [problems that don't yet exist][problems] for me. Part of what takes me so long working on anything is the that there are sooo many good solutions to problems that don't yet have the priority. There's usually some new way of doing something that I want to tryout. I've decided to keep this static site simple and to the point with the solutioning. If it works out of the box, then it works. If it doesn't fulfill a need I'll add it as a feature. This is my inner geek.\n\n[Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and static site generation has been a bit of a tech geek trend.

This blog is a bunch of static HTML pages generated on my local computer. And there are a ton of solutions for this, but for me, this is as simple as it gets, and simplicity is key when it comes getting myself to write more and self-publish. Static site generation solves my immediate problem and I’m not having to sign up for another account. Granted there is a bit of a setup overhead, with a GitHub repo, and choosing a static site generator, in this case, <a href=\"https://hexo.io/\">Hexo</a>. This allows me to have a simple markdown file as my medium to write and format words on to the screen.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Solving-problems-by-not-solving-them\"><a href=\"#Solving-problems-by-not-solving-them\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Solving problems by not solving them\"></a>Solving problems by not solving them</h2><p>There’s not a whole lot of features to this method, but it solves my problem. It encourages me to not solving <a href=\"[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1454753]\">problems that don’t yet exist</a> for me. Part of what takes me so long working on anything is the that there are sooo many good solutions to problems that don’t yet have the priority. There’s usually some new way of doing something that I want to tryout. I’ve decided to keep this static site simple and to the point with the solutioning. If it works out of the box, then it works. If it doesn’t fulfill a need I’ll add it as a feature. This is my inner geek.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">Github pages</a> and static site generation has been a bit of a tech geek trend. It’s common for open source projects, documentation, and personal websites to get created through static site generator. I’ve taken a lot of <a href=\"https://zachholman.com/\">inspiration</a> from other techies and <a href=\"https://likescoffee.com/\">friends</a>. Their sites are clean simple, and focused. They’re used as at tool for learning, sharing insights, reflections and mental notes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Always-be-learning-always-be-thoughtful\"><a href=\"#Always-be-learning-always-be-thoughtful\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Always be learning, always be thoughtful\"></a>Always be learning, always be thoughtful</h2><p>This site, too, will be a place for learning, and keeping my thoughts logged and retracable. And as I encounter a problem, I’ll solve it adding bit by bit. It’ll a place of simple self-expression. It’s not part of any other content network or social media, and people visiting the site hopefully are being delibrate to catch up with what I’m doing or not doing for that matter. Really though, if no one reads this, at the very least I’ll be reflecting and thinking more about my day today job, life and interests. Let it be about learning and reflecting on my thoughts.</p>\n"},{"title":"Ezekiel Hsieh Wu","author":"Tommy","date":"2017-05-11T18:59:00.000Z","_content":"Ezekiel\n\nYou're finally here!
