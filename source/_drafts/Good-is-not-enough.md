What does it mean when doing good is not enough?

Jesus did not come to this earth to make us good people, but he came to make us alive.

We are a generation with a worldview that wants to do good. We are asking the questions of our purpose, meaning, origin and moral compass. We are doing lots of good, but not knowing the source of what is Good, is where there is a tragedy in a generation.

To do Good, but yet not know God, the source of all Good, is not enough. Because, doing good, shouldn't be our intrinsic self worth. Our identity is not our work and the good that we do. Our sole purpose isn't to simply do good. But, instead, our identity, self-worth, meaning, and purpose comes from knowing God-  God as our father, God as our savior, God as our creator.
