I came across [Gerhard Lazu](http://gerhard.lazu.co.uk/) while listening to how the [changelog.com](https://www.changelog.com) get's deployed with their Elixir setup.

In the changelog podcast Gerhard shares his thoughts and philosophy about how he works with the Changelog guys to on a slick deployment pipeline for the new website. I recommend listening to the podcast to glean some good technical insights: https://changelog.com/podcast/254

What I appreciate, though, is how Gerhard breaks down the work for building the pipeline with the [stakeholders](https://changelog.com/about) while not be around them physically and having limited time juggling full-time job and family. Here's the [speaker deck](https://speakerdeck.com/gerhardlazu/not-working-together) he's shared in a talk last year.

The title mantras:

### Not Working Together (And Still Delivering Value)

### Solve Tiny Problems Everyday

### Do the Wrong Thing (In Minutes)

### Do the Simple Thing (Even if it's Incomplete)

### Make Small Changes (And Deliver Continuously)

### Preserve Conversations (In the Original Context)

### Write Immutable Documentation (Anchor it with Context)

### Ask Continuously (Is This What You Mean?)

### Answer Continuously (Why Did I Do This?)

### Insist on Separating 'What' from the 'Why'

### Users do not care about the HOW

### Work a Few Hours at Most (Ask & Wait  for Feedback)

### Do All the Above ^ (Even when you work together)

### Work Alone (When you are impatient)

### Learn & Share (Do. Not. Work.)
